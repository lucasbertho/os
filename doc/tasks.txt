10/09/2022: understand why the BIOS is emulating the USB flash drive as a floppy disk on physical hardware.

One of the easiest ways to read or write a USB flash drive is to drop into Real or Unreal Mode, and use the INT 0x13 BIOS commands.
However, the transfer must fit in the usable part of low memory (if in Real Mode), and you need to somehow know the proper drive
number to use in DL.

BIOS can emulate USB flash drives as a floppy drive or as an hard disk. If the USB drive is emulated as a floppy drive, it is likely
0x00 or 0x01 and you can only use AH=0x02 and AH=0x03. If it's emulated as an hard disk, it is most likely 0x80 or 0x81 and you can
also use AH=0x42 and AH=0x43.
[FIXED] 10/11/2022: The boot loader was missing the BIOS parameter block (BPB) to emulate a DOS 4.0 EBPB 1.44MB floppy.
